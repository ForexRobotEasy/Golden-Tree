# Golden Tree Expert Advisor

The Golden Tree Expert Advisor is an aggressive scalping strategy designed for trading Gold (XAUUSD) on the M1 timeframe. It implements a multi-cycle scalping approach with a progressive pricing structure every 5 cycles. This Expert Advisor provides trading functions for order placement, execution, and monitoring, as well as analysis of past data to identify strong recurrences.

## Input Parameters

The following input parameters can be adjusted to customize the Expert Advisor's behavior:

- **takeProfit**: The initial take profit level for each order.
- **stopLoss**: The initial stop loss level for each order.
- **cycleCount**: The number of cycles to execute.

## Global Variables

The Expert Advisor keeps track of the number of executed orders using the global variable `orderCount`.

## Expert Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is called during Expert Advisor initialization. It outputs the initial parameters to the log for reference.

## Expert Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is called during Expert Advisor deinitialization. It outputs a deinitialization message to the log.

## Expert Start

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick. It checks if the number of executed orders (`orderCount`) is less than the specified number of cycles (`cycleCount`). If so, it places and executes a new order using the `PlaceOrder()` function. It then increments the `orderCount`, adjusts the take profit and stop loss levels using the `AdjustLevels()` function, monitors and adjusts market conditions in real-time using the `MonitorConditions()` function, and analyzes past data for strong recurrences using the `AnalyzePastData()` function.

If the number of executed orders is equal to or greater than the specified number of cycles, the Expert Advisor finishes and outputs a completion message to the log. The `ExpertRemove()` function is used to remove the Expert Advisor from the chart.

## Place and Execute a New Order

The `PlaceOrder()` function is a placeholder for the actual logic to place and execute a new order. It should be replaced with the appropriate logic for the desired trading strategy. The function should return `true` if the order placement and execution are successful.

## Calculate and Adjust Take Profit and Stop Loss Levels

The `AdjustLevels()` function is a placeholder for the logic to calculate and adjust the take profit and stop loss levels. It should be replaced with the appropriate logic based on the desired trading strategy.

## Monitor and Adjust Market Conditions in Real-Time

The `MonitorConditions()` function is a placeholder for the logic to monitor and adjust market conditions in real-time. It should be replaced with the appropriate logic based on the desired trading strategy.

## Analyze Past Data for Strong Recurrences

The `AnalyzePastData()` function is a placeholder for the logic to analyze past data for strong recurrences. It should be replaced with the appropriate logic based on the desired trading strategy.
